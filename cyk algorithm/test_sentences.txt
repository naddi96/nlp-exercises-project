But	while	the	New	York	Stock	Exchange	did	n't	fall	apart	Friday	as	the	Dow	Jones	Industrial	Average	plunged	190.58	points	--	most	of	it	in	the	final	hour	--	it	barely	managed	to	stay	this	side	of	chaos	.

The	49	stock	specialist	firms	on	the	Big	Board	floor	--	the	buyers	and	sellers	of	last	resort	who	were	criticized	after	the	1987	crash	--	once	again	could	n't	handle	the	selling	pressure	.
